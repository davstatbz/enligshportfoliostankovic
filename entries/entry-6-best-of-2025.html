<h1>Portfolio Entry #6 – Best of 2025</h1>

<h2>Albums I already knew</h2>
<p>
From the list, I already knew these artists/albums (at least by name): Bad Bunny – <i>DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS</i>, Playboi Carti – <i>MUSIC</i>, PinkPantheress – <i>Fancy That</i>, and FKA twigs – <i>EUSEXUA</i>.
</p>

<h2>Albums I listened to from the list</h2>
<p>
I listened to one song from these five albums:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Addison Rae – <i>Addison</i></li>
  <li>Bad Bunny – <i>DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS</i></li>
  <li>PinkPantheress – <i>Fancy That</i></li>
  <li>FKA twigs – <i>EUSEXUA</i></li>
  <li>Blood Orange – <i>Essex Honey</i></li>
</ul>

<h2>My favourite album</h2>
<p>
My favourite from the five was PinkPantheress – <i>Fancy That</i>. I liked it because it feels light, catchy, and easy to listen to. It’s the kind of music I can play while walking or on the train.
</p>

<h2>Albums missing from the list</h2>
<p>
For me, the list could also include more big mainstream rap/pop albums. Pitchfork has a special taste, but I think popular albums can still be very good and deserve a spot too.
</p>
