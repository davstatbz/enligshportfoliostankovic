<h1>Portfolio Entry #1 – Summer Updates</h1>

<h2>Highlight 1</h2>
<p>
My first highlight was traveling to Serbia by car with my father. We drove alone because my mother and my brother had fewer holidays and came later by plane.
</p>

<p>
We stopped many times to buy drinks and snacks. There was surprisingly very little traffic, which made the trip much easier. It rained a lot during the drive, almost all the time.
</p>

<p>
We drove through Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, and Serbia. I really enjoyed this trip because I normally do not spend such a long time alone with my father. I felt like I got to know him on a completely different level.
</p>

<h2>Highlight 2</h2>
<p>
My second highlight was going to a club in Serbia called Delfin. It was a bit far away, but that was not a problem. I went home together with my cousin after the club.

<p>
It was a very good night, and the club was partly open, which made it perfect for summer.
</p>

<h2>Highlight 3</h2>
<p>
My last highlight was spending the last four days of our holidays in Lido di Jesolo. It is about halfway between Serbia and Switzerland.
</p>

<p>
It was very fun and beautiful, and the best part was that the whole family was there. In the evenings, we mostly went out to eat, which was a nice change and very relaxing.
</p>

<h2>Lowlight</h2>
<p>
My lowlight happened when I was riding my cousin’s quad. At first, everything was fine. On the way back, my cousin drove, and he took a curve too fast.
</p>

<p>
We crashed into a pole, and I injured my thigh. We went to the pharmacy, where I got an ointment and a bandage.
</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>
Luckily, I could still walk more or less normally. The injury healed over time, and everything turned out fine in the end.
