      <h1>Portfolio Entry #4 – Conditional Story</h1>

      <p>
        If I had to go to school every day, my life would feel very different.
      </p>

      <p>
        I only have school once a week and work four days, which gives me a lot of practical experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        If I worked less and stayed more at school, I would probably miss learning things directly at work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes work can be stressful, but it helps me become more independent and responsible also for my private life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking back, I am happy with this system, because it fits me well and prepares me for the future.
