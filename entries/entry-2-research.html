      <h2>Chosen Task: Story Writing</h2>

      <p>
        This is a short story about an embarrassing moment that happened to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        One morning, I was already late for school. I rushed out of the house and took the bus as fast as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I arrived at school, I noticed that people were looking at me and smiling. At first, I did not understand why.
      </p>

      <p>
        A friend came up to me and told me that I was wearing two different shoes. One was black and the other one was white.
      </p>

      <p>
        I felt very embarrassed, but after a moment we all started laughing. I stayed at school like that for the whole day.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end, it was not such a big problem, and it taught me to stay calm even in embarrassing situations.
