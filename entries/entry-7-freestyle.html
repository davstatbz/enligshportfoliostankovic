      <h2>MMA</h2>

      <p>
        One thing I really like is MMA. I started watching it a few years ago and I found it interesting very quickly. What I like about MMA is that it is not boring. Every fight is different and anything can happen.

        I mostly watch the UFC because it has the best fighters. I like that fights can end very fast and that fighters always have to be ready. One mistake can change the whole fight.

        My favorite fighter is Edson Barboza. I like him because of his kicks. His leg kicks are very strong and he has a cool fighting style. When he fights, I always enjoy watching him.

        I also train MMA myself. I have been training for about one and a half years at 360 Martial Arts in Zurich. Training is hard and sometimes exhausting, but I like it. It helps me clear my head and feel better after a long day.

        For me, MMA is not just about fighting. It is also about training, discipline, and pushing yourself.
